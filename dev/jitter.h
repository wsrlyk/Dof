jitter.h 
 
This file contains jitter point arrays for 2,3,4,8,15,24 and 66 jitters. 
 
The arrays are named j2, j3, etc. Each element in the array has the form, 
for example, j8[0].x and j8[0].y 
 
Values are floating point in the range -.5 < x < .5, -.5 < y < .5, and 
have a gaussian distribution around the origin. 
 
Use these to do model jittering for scene anti-aliasing and view volume 
jittering for depth of field effects. Use in conjunction with the  
accwindow() routine.
